# Error 1
```
generate-random-integers: undefined;
 cannot reference an identifier before its definition
```

# Change 1 
This is defined at the end of the program so cannot be called by a function above it 
```
;; Function to generate random integers (provided in the problem statement)
(define (generate-random-integers count min-value max-value)
  (define (generate n)
    (if (zero? n)
        '()
        (cons (+ min-value (random (- max-value min-value)))
              (generate (- n 1)))))
  (generate count))
```
To fix this Is imply copy and pasted it above the functions calling it

# Error 2
```
 take: contract violation
  expected: a list with at least 5 elements
  given: '(78 79 35)
```

# Change 2
in the function `partition-into-scublists`
Changed this ``
to this `(let ([sublist (if (< (length lst) n) lst (take lst n))]) ;; Handle cases where lst has fewer than n elements (cons sublist (partition-into-sublists (drop lst (length sublist)) n))))) ;; Drop only the actual size of sublist`
