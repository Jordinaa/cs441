- 30-40 multiple choice questions
---
- when language was introduced
	- how well it worked
	- design goals 

- Steps for compiler
	- **Source code**
		- **scanner - lexer**
		- turns it into a stream of tokens
		- this is an identifier
		- semicolon
		- parenthesis
			- **parser**
			- checks it against the grammar 
			- syntactically correct
			- does not look at issues of meaning 
			- right scope etc
				- **syntax tree or parse tree**
				- which is a more abstract representation of the program
					- **semantic analyzer** 
					- checks all the rules the parser cant
					- type
					- scope
					- dynamically scoped can't do it until runtime (depends on language)
						- **code generator** - frontier between front end and back end
							- we could run it through a code optimizer 
							- not necessary 
							- assembly code or assembler not in scope of course
								- **object code**
									- **linker**
										- **executable (.exe)**
- Steps for interpreter
	- Source code
		- scanner - lexer

						- dynamically scoped can't do it until runtime (depends on language)
							- abstract tree 
								- **code generator** - frontier between front end and back end
								- few tree walking routine and interpreter can pick it up from here and we can do a function call
									- Could we might run it through a code optimizer 
									- not necessary 
									- assembly code or assembler not in scope of course
										- **instead of object code we have java byte code or something**
											- then intermediate language 
- same has compiler except instead of code generator
	- abstract trees
- instead of object code
	- byte code
NOTE: garbage collection bad overhead
