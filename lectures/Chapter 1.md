# fundamental questions 
- language
	- medium of communication
- program
	- ordered set of instructions
- programming language 
	- system of data manipulation rules for describing computation
- programming language concept
	- best defined by example typically have options

Sapir-Whord hypothesis
- ones capacity to think is limited by the language through which one communicates ones thoughts
- some programming idioms cannot be expressed as easily in some

---
# Bindings - static and dynamic
- binding
	- refer to association of one aspect of a program or programming lanugage to another
- language definition time
- language implementation time
- compile time
- link time
- load time
- run time

earlier times imply
- safety
- reliability
- predictability no surprises
- efficiency

# 1.4 Styles of programming
- syntax - form
	- colorless green ideas dream mercilessly
	- follows all rules for an english sentence - syntax is perfectly correct 
- semantics - meaning
- first class entity
	- special privileges we can do things with but cannot 
	- output or input into a function
	- array is NOT a first class object
	- Vector is a first class object can assign it a value 
- side effect
	- 
- referential transparency
	- independent of evaluation order
	- means the same thing no matter where you evaluate it 
	- a function that is pure is same output 

1. imperative
	1. command based 
		1. C
		2. Fortran
2. functional
	1. computation primarily by calling a series of functions which cascade a set of return values to each other
	2. without variables assignment and iteration
	3. possible to program without variables and assignment statements
3. object oriented
	1. collection of objects communicating by passing messages to each other
	2. objects passing information around
4. logical declarative
	1. describe what we are going to compute not how to compute it 
	2. grounded in first-order predicate calculus a formal system of symbolic language
		1. specify rules facts and define and ask what fits within these parameters
5. bottom up
	1. not to develop a solution to a problem but rather to build a language specifically tailored to solving a family of problems for which the problem at hand is an instance 
	2. HTML/CSS, LaTeX, postscript, Docker, Jenkins
6. synthesis beyond paradigms
	1. 
7. language evaluation criteria
	1. concepts of languages provide the basis from which to foster comparative analysis 
	2. non functional requirements
		1. readability 
			1. how easy is it to write a piece of code
		2. writability
			1. how easy is it to produce a unit of code? (line block subroutine etc)
			2. how elaborate are the syntactical requirements? 
		3. reliability
			1. is something goes wrong in the program how do we detect it?
		4. maintainabililty 
			1. can the code be modified bug fixes applied refactoring carried out relatively easily or is rewriting from the beginning the only real option
		5. expressivity
			1. how easy is it to say what we mean
		6. effeciency
			1. how quickly
		7. cost 
	3. perl 
8. though process for problem solving

# 1.5 Factors influencing language development 
- computer architecture influenced programming language design and implementation 
- use of the von Neumann architecture inspired the design of many early programming languages that dovetailed with the model
